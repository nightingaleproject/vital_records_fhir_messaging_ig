### Changes
* Added note regarding lack of support for [extraction error messages](message.html#message-extraction-failures) by NCHS API (November 2022)
* Added Alias Message based on input from Veronique, Krynn, and Aaina in February 2021
* Changed canonical URL to http://cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/fhir/vital-records-messaging
* All messages use the same basic parameter structure.  Not sure this was the case previously.
