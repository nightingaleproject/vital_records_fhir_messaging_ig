## FHIR IGs
Submissions to NCHS are based on the following FHIR IGs:
* HL7 Vital Records Death Reporting STU2.2
* NCHS Vital Records FHIR Messaging v1.0.0

Periodically, NCHS will transition the submission process to use new published versions of these IGs.
As with any software product or specification, bugs/issues will be identified between publication events.
The purpose of this document is to provide documentation about known bugs/issues/errata in the published specifications that implementers may need to successfully implement FHIR-based death record submission.
